# CO2Meter
- Made an Arduino kit that measures CO2

This project uses various sensors to collect and display
    Temperature
    Humidity
    Carbon Dioxide
    
In real time it calculates the average CO2 reading.

This was a project I started in sophmore year of high school. I've been competing in science fairs since freshman year of high school experimenting to understand which field I want to study in college / University. That is until the summer of sophomore year when I had the opportunity to create a device that could be used to map pollution data, hence this sensor.
